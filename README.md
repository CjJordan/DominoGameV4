## [Overview](#overview)
A domino game in which pre-programmed strategies are played against each other to determine an ideal domino strategy. 

## [How to Play](#how-to-play)
1. Select a strategy from each drop down menu at the top right and left
2. Input a score at which game play should end in the 'Max Score' box
3. Press play.


## [Planned Enhancements](#planned-enhancements)
- Once the strategies are ranked, an advanced, medium, and easy strategy will be chosen. The game will then be converted into a player vs computer game in which the player will select a level of strategy to play against. 
- The max score box will have a default and a drop-down rather than free text option to improve UX.
- Animation will be be added to improve UX.

## [Design Specs](#design-specs)
The main method is in the GameManager class.
